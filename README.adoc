## Project overview
For this project i had to redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. This project gave me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, to update and change an app's design as new standards are released.

## What i learned
- To understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- To apply Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
- To separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively to use transitions and motion.
